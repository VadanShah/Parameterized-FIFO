Parameterized-FIFO
ðŸ“¦ Parameterized FIFO Buffer â€“ Verilog Implementation âœ… Summary This project implements a parameterized synchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffer in Verilog HDL. It supports configurable DATA_WIDTH, DEPTH, and corresponding ADDR_WIDTH. The design ensures reliable data transfer with edge-detected write and read pulses and dynamic buf_empty and buf_full status flags.
Key features include:
Parameterized data width and depth.
FIFO counter to monitor occupancy level.
Debounce and edge detection using 2-bit synchronizers (wr_sync, rd_sync) for stable input control signals.
Separate read (rd_ptr) and write (wr_ptr) pointers for managing memory access.
Memory implemented as a register array (buf_mem) for simulation, which can be mapped to block RAM on FPGAs.
Outputs buf_empty, buf_full, and current fifo_counter value.
